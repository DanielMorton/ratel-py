Welcome to Ratel-Py's documentation!
====================================

Ratel-Py is the Python implementation of the Ratel multi-armed bandit simulator. It consists of two main components,
a `bandit` with several arms and rewards determined by a probability distribution and an `agent` that tries to find
the optimal strategy for playing the bandit.
